# Lab 4
Turtle Graphics

All of the methods for this lab will be written in the TurtleGraphics.py file. In your main() function, you can uncomment one of the function calls. You only need to do one at a time but each of the given commands should work.

## Importing to Repl.it
There are two ways to bring your work into repl.it
- Import from GitHub as normal.
  - The downside is that the turtle graphics window is not as nice.
- Make a new repl.it using Python (with turtle)
  - You will then have to copy and paste the starter code into that repl.it


### drawPolygon(turtle, sides)
Will draw a polygon given the number of sides.

### fillCorner(turtle, corner)
Draws a square with one of the corners filled in. Imagine that your square is divided with a horizontal and vertical line. Fill in one of the quadrants based on the input that the function is given.
1 - Top left
2 - Top right
3 - Bottom left
4 - Bottom right

## Testing your code
You may not actually know that your code works until you fully test what you have written. It is often a good idea to get someone else to run your program, they may do something you had not anticipated which could show you a possible flaw or at least a design issue.

## End of class
In Repl.it, you will find the share link to your code. That is what gets submitted to Canvas.
