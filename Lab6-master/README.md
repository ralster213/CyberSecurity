### DiceRoll.py
Statistical analysis of dice rolls.
Create a simulation that rolls 2 dice and finds their total.
This simulation should run at least 10,000 times.
Once complete, the distribution of totals should be displayed.
Display the values both as a count (how many) and a percentage of rolls.

### WordCount.py
A common utility on Unix/Linux systems is a small program called "wc".  This program analyzes a file to determine the number of lines, words, and characters contained therein.

Write your own version of wc.  The program should accept a file name as input and then print three numbers showing the count of lines, words, and characters in the file.

SAMPLE OUTPUT
```
Enter a File Name: text.txt

Lines: 12
Words: 48
Characters:249
```

### WordIndex.py
We want to create a word index that keeps record of every word in a file, and what line numbers that word can be found on.
Using dictionaries in python, each word will have an associated list of line numbers.
```
words = {'hello': [2, 5] , 'world': [2, 4]}
```
This signifies that the word 'hello' is on lines 2 and 5; the word 'world' is on lines 2 and 4.

You should be able to print each word followed by the page line numbers of those words, like an index at the back of a textbook.

## Testing your code
You may not actually know that your code works until you fully test what you have written. It is often a good idea to get someone else to run your program, they may do something you had not anticipated which could show you a possible flaw or at least a design issue.

## End of class
In Repl.it, you will find the share link to your code. That is what gets submitted to Canvas.
